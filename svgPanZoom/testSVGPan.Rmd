Testing in rMarkdown document the htmlwidget [svgPanZoom]("https://github.com/timelyportfolio/svgPanZoom") by timelyportfolio which enables R graphics to be pan/zoomable 


Just tried ggplot plots

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(ggplot2)
library(svgPanZoom)
#library(SVGAnnotation) # could not run in shiny.io as not CRAN , github

```

First a static version. This appears on 'Run Document' but when opening in browser(Chrome) fails to appear. This may have nothing to do with the widget
```{r, echo=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, cyl)) + geom_point(size=3, pch=19) + theme_bw()

 p
```

Then one with the widget following recommended practice. Using a touchpad, I had to add the controlIconsEnabled = T  

The plot is smaller and does not show axes - at least by default. Panning and zooming works fine

```{r, echo=TRUE}
svgPanZoom(
  svgPlot(
 show(p)    
),controlIconsEnabled = T)
```


An alternative method requiring the gridSVG library  

In RStudio viewer, the panning works, and the look (inc axes) is as per static version but the zoom control does not appear

It is a bit weird in rMarkdown. Two static versions folowed by the correct outcome appear. However, when opening in browser it looks fine

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(gridSVG)

svgPanZoom(
 p,controlIconsEnabled = T  
  )
```


Now try a ggmap

Works fine in browser. Of course zooming in does not provide any extra info
but could still be useful

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggmap)
hdf <- get_map()
q <-ggmap(hdf, extent = 'normal')

svgPanZoom(
 q,controlIconsEnabled = T  
  )
```
Publishing to shiny.io proved problematic

"Unable to deploy package dependency 'SVGAnnotation'
   
   The package was installed locally from source. Only packages
   installed from CRAN, BioConductor and GitHub are supported.
Execution halted"

But this is on GitHub??
